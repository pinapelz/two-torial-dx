??? tip "Option 3: Local e-amuse Emulator (MonkeyBusiness)"

    For instructions on setting up MonkeyBusiness, please refer to our [MonkeyBusiness setup guide](/extras/monkeybusiness.md).

    After MonkeyBusiness is setup with the proper plugin for your game:

    - Open `spicecfg.exe` and head to the `Options` tab
    - Under the `Network` category, set your `EA Service URL (-url)` to point to your asphyxia server, typically `http://localhost:8083/core`
